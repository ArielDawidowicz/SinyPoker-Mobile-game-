# SinyPoker-Mobile-game


In this project I built a card game called Siny Poker, in Hebrew Siny is Chinese (but I found out that Chinese poker is already being used?!).
I learned and used to play this game while traveling in Central America, and then in my own country with my friends.
As a personal project I built this game including writing the code, logic of the algorithms and the design.

The rules are simple:
The game is 1 VS 1, in this version it is offline only vs "PC".
At the beginning each player gets 5 cards in one row.
Each card represents a poker hand.
Each turn the player draws a card from the deck and places the card in their hand to create a strong poker hand
(high card, pair, two pairs, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, full house, 4 of a kind, straight and royal flush).
The catch is that the new card cannot be assigned in every hand:
- First line divided at the beginning.
- The next cards can be placed in the second row then the third row and so on.

The fifth card is placed upside down so that you cannot see your opponent's last card (and vice versa)
At the end, each player receives one card that can be exchanged with every fifth card in each hand (the last row). The exchange is not mandatory.

The best of 5 hands wins the game.
