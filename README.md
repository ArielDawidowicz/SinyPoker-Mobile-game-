# SinyPoker-Mobile-game


In this project i built a card game named Siny Poker, in Hebrew Siny is Chinese (but I found out that Chinese poker is already used ?!).
I learned and use to play this game while i was traveling in central America, and then in my country with my friends.
As a personal project i built this game including writing the code, algorithms logic and the design.

the rules are simple:
the game is 1 VS 1, in this version is only offline vs the "PC".
At the beginning each player gets 5 cards in one row.
each card represents a poker hand.
in each turn the player draws a card from the deck and puts the card in the hand to make a strong poker hand 
(High card, pair, two pairs, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, full house, 4 of a kind, straight flush and royal flush).
the catch is that the new card cannot be assigned in any hand:
- first row is divided in the beginning.
- than the cards can be put down in the second row than the third and so on.

At the end, each player gets one card that can be swapped with any fifth card in any hand (the last row) the swap is not mandatory.

Best of 5 hands wins the game.
